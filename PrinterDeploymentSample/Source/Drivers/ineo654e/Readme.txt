       any following jobs are not printed unless the stopping job is canceled.    
       Please ask your administrator to cancel the limitation to output the stopping 
       job or someone must delete the job after confirmation.

       the status of the "[Account Track] of  Enhanced Server Authentication" could not 
       be acquired.

==========================================================================================
8-3. Attentions and Restrictions when using a PS driver
==========================================================================================

 1. PostScript Pass through
    Depending on applications to use, some functions of printer drivers might not work
    correctly.  For example, Watermarks specified by printer drivers would be 
    printed in unexpectedly large size when printing from Adobe Photoshop.
    ==>this may be solved by setting [PostScript Pass through] to [Disable] 
       in printer drivers.
       * The following cases are the error samples.
        - Output cannot be performed normally when Adobe Application and Overlay are
          combined.
        - Watermark specified by printer driver may be printed larger than the size
          you specified when printing with Adobe Photoshop.

       shape document) in some application, the device may print the document with
       rotating its direction.
       This means for example that staple or punch may be made in the different 
       position of the document from the expected one.

  3-2. When [Paper Size] is set to [Custom Size] and a print job is sent, the [Paper Size]
       set on the MFP may be different than the what is set in the Printer Driver,
       but the printed output will be normal.

         to 15mm.

==========================================================================================
8-4. Cautions and restrictions with specific applications
==========================================================================================

 1. Microsoft Office
  1-1. AutoShapes Graphics Print in Office [* PS Driver only]

          Adobe Acrobat X, you need to configure the [Page Setup] setting first and 
          then configure the Printer Driver Properties menu.  

  2-6. When [Select paper by corresponding to PDF's page size] setting available
       in the Acrobat`s print dialog box is enabled,

 3. Adobe PageMaker, Illustrator
  3-1. Depending on applications, such as Adobe PageMaker, Illustrator and etc, 
       if it recognizes that it is a PostScript printer driver, the application itself 
       may output PostScript commands. In this case, it may not be printed correctly.
       [* PS Driver only]

  3-2. When the Illustrator file with paper size A0/A1/B1 is printed with Illustrator CS, 
       a part of the image is lost.
       With Illustrator CS2 or more, this problem doesn't occur.

  4-1. Check the selected printer when printing continuously by the Internet Explorer
       or Note Pad.
       Selected printer might differ from the previous selection if several same
       printer drivers have been installed, depending on the application limitation.
       ==>In this case, change the printer driver name with 
          which selection will be changed, to less than 29 characters.

 5. Excel
  5-1. Check the print settings before printing when you print from Excel after 
       switching the printer driver.
       Depending on the limitation of application, current printer driver setting might 
       apply to the printer driver after switching.
       ==>In that case, change the name of a printer driver used to within 29 characters. 

  5-2. When you want to print multiple Excel sheets simultaneously, printing may not be 
       successfully executed.
       This is a result of different printer driver settings for each sheet.

          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
